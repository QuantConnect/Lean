/// <summary>
/// Represents the Tom Demark Sequential indicator, which is used to identify potential trend exhaustion points.
/// This implementation tracks both the setup and countdown phases, and can be extended to handle bullish and bearish setups,
/// as well as qualifiers such as Perfect Setups and Countdown completions.
/// 
/// - **Setup Phase**: Detects a trend by counting 9 consecutive bars where the close is less than (Buy Setup)
///   or greater than (Sell Setup) the close 4 bars earlier.
/// - **TDST Support/Resistance**: After a valid 9-bar setup completes, the indicator records the **lowest low** (for Sell Setup)
///   or **highest high** (for Buy Setup) among the 9 bars. These are referred to as Support Price(for Buy Setup) and
///   Resistance Price (for Sell Setup), and serve as critical thresholds that validate the continuation of the countdown phase.
/// - **Countdown Phase**: Once a valid setup is completed, the indicator attempts to count 13 qualifying bars (not necessarily consecutive)
///   where the close is less than (Buy Countdown) or greater than (Sell Countdown) the low/high 2 bars earlier.
///   During this phase, the TDST Support/Resistance levels are checked â€” if the price breaks these levels, the countdown phase is reset,
///   as the trend reversal condition is considered invalidated.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This implementation uses a rolling window of 10 bars and begins logic when at least 5 bars are available.
