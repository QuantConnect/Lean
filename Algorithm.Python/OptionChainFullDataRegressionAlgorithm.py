### <summary>
### Regression algorithm illustrating the usage of the <see cref="QCAlgorithm.OptionChain(Symbol)"/> method
### to get an option chain, which contains additional data besides the symbols, including prices, implied volatility and greeks.
### It also shows how this data can be used to filter the contracts based on certain criteria.
