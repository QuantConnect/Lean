### <summary>
### This regression algorithm tests Out of The Money (OTM) future option expiry for puts.
### We expect 2 orders from the algorithm, which are:
###
###   * Initial entry, buy ES Put Option (expiring OTM)
###     - contract expires worthless, not exercised, so never opened a position in the underlying
###
###   * Liquidation of worthless ES Put OTM contract
###
### Additionally, we test delistings for future options and assert that our
### portfolio holdings reflect the orders the algorithm has submitted.
### </summary>
### <remarks>
### Total Trades in regression algorithm should be 1, but expiration is counted as a trade.
### </remarks>
